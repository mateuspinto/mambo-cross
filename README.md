# MAMBO-Cross: A Low-Overhead Dynamic Binary Modification Tool for ARM with full cross-compilation support

I don't own MAMBO, Pie or Libelf. Credits of MAMBO and Pie go to Beehive Lab (https://github.com/beehive-lab) and Libelf goes to MR511 (http://www.mr511.de/software/). License file and original README's are on the subfolders.

## Requiriments
- Ruby
- GCC (for native compilation in ARM32 or AARCH64)
- Arm-linux-gnu-gcc (for cross-compilation for ARM32)
- Aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc (for cross-compilation for AARCH64)
- QEMU (for simulation in x86, x64 or others)

# Who am I?
My name is **Mateus Pinto da Silva**, I'm a Brazilian redhead computer scientist (currently graduating), who loves to program in Python using Object-oriented Programming and to describe hardware in Verilog HDL. I'm a data science enthusiast, current intern of a Brazilian Enterprise called Cinnecta. I like to train models in TensorFlowAPI when I have nothing better to do, and if you check my github profile, you will see that I usually don't have nothing better to do in fact. I study on Federal University of Vi√ßosa.

## About my trajectory with C
All that I learned from C language came from my university lessons of AEDS I and AEDS II (Algorithms and Data Structures) and obviously from standalone researchs that I made, especially in "*The C Programming Language*", by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie
